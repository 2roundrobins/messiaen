# massiaen BETA v0.1
 norns script based on birdsong

single buffer delay / looper for mimicking birdsong
this is far from finished and I intend to make this at least somewhat workable

but here is what you need if you want to test;

## hardware

**required**

- [norns](https://github.com/p3r7/awesome-monome-norns) (220802 or later)
  - **the required norns version is recent, please be sure that your norns is up-to-date before launching**


## install

install directly from gitHub

or

in the maiden type:

```
;install https://github.com/2roundrobins/massiaen
```


## start

recommended: luanch the script from the norns [SELECT](https://monome.org/docs/norns/play/#select) menu.

## controls

### recording

start by recording something into the buffer. do this by pressing K3 and you'll see that your birdie will get an exlamation mark - this mean the bird is listening. you can record a sound into it and press K3 again. doing this, you have now stored the sound. turn E3 and you will hear your verry short loop. you can also turn E2 to change the position of the micro loop. 

### playing

press K2 and the bird will start singing random song based on it's species. you can stop the playing by pressing K2 again. by moving E1 you can change the bird species and the birdsong. 

### adding ambience

by pressing K1 you can add "plant" a forest and put your bird in a habitat. you can also change the habitat in the PARAMs menu.
